CROSS BIRD 
Ahoy there, me hearty! *Squawk* I'm Cross Bird, the pirate parrot. 
CROSS BIRD 
I see you are with the pirate ship Signet Messenger! *Squawk* Chief Engineer no less! 
CROSS BIRD 
I have been a ship’s parrot going over 200 years now *Squawk* and have seen me fair share of repairs. How can I help ye? 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
I’ve been hearing some scuttlebutt from the Pirate School of Engineering about a way to get better at making repairs. What do ye know of it? 
CROSS BIRD 
Aye! There is. *Squawk* 
CROSS BIRD 
Have ya heard of Model Based Systems Engineering? 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
Some. Tell me more. 
CROSS BIRD 
*Squawk* Model-based systems engineering, or MBSE for short, is a way of designing and building complex systems using computer models. 
CROSS BIRD 
It can help ye be better pirate engineers by improving the ship systems’ efficiency and effectiveness. *Squawk* 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
How so? 
CROSS BIRD 
As an engineer, ye know how important it is to make sure ships and systems are safe and reliable to take on them thar new adventures. 
CROSS BIRD 
Systems Engineering (SE) can help test ye different approaches to see how the ship’s systems would behave under different conditions.  
CROSS BIRD 
These systems can include hardware, software, information, processes, facilities and more, working together as part of an interconnecting network.  
CROSS BIRD 
When they work together, the system performs in a way that is different than how each individual part behaves. *Squawk* 
CROSS BIRD 
MBSE is a form of SE. With MBSE, ye can create digital models of our ships and systems to show us all the important parts and how they fit together. 
CROSS BIRD 
Need to take on the Pirates of Ambush Island? Ye can model their defenses and test the Signet Messenger’s canon upgrades before spending many chests of ye gold. 
CROSS BIRD 
*Squawk* Thar models help ye better understand the approach to repairing the ships, and to catch any potential problems before they become too costly to fix.  
CROSS BIRD 
Is that something ye think ye can learn? *Squawk* 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
I think so. There be a process to follow? 
CROSS BIRD 
Aye! *Squawk* There be six core steps of Systems Engineering. 
CROSS BIRD 
1) Requirements Development and System Analysis 
CROSS BIRD 
2) Logical Analysis and Design Solution 
CROSS BIRD 
3) Implementation 
CROSS BIRD 
4) Integration 
CROSS BIRD 
5) Verification and Validation 
CROSS BIRD 
and 6) Transition 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
That sounds straightforward. What should Ye’ know about each step? 
CROSS BIRD 
*Squawk* Aye, great question! Ye be a smart one… 
CROSS BIRD 
Using the Requirements Development and System Analysis step, ye crew uses computer models to simulate different scenarios and identify the requirements for making yon ship repairs. 
CROSS BIRD 
Y’all have to consider factors like *Squawk* available resources, time constraints, safety requirements, and risks involved. 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
Got it. What’s next? 
CROSS BIRD 
For the Logical Analysis and Design Solution step ye use the same models to design and optimize the repair solutions. 
CROSS BIRD 
*Squawk* Yon team needs to continue to balance factors like risk, speed, power, and safety to come up with a logical design solution that meets all the requirements. 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
And then what happens? 
CROSS BIRD 
Ye has ta’ get ‘er done in the Implementation step. *Squawk* 
CROSS BIRD 
This means actually carrying out the repairs. 
CROSS BIRD 
Then, with the Integration step, ye have to make sure everything works together smoothly and efficiently with the ship’s existing systems. 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
And how do we make sure everything is working properly? 
CROSS BIRD 
*Squawk* Ye haf’ta do the Verification and Validation step with the computer models. 
CROSS BIRD 
Ye’ crew needs to test and verify that everything is working correctly and validate that it meets all the requirements. 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
Then we’re done? 
CROSS BIRD 
*Squawk* Almost! Ye’ gots’ ta wrap up ye work. 
CROSS BIRD 
The Transition step gets the ship back to its normal operating mode, and move ye crew to the next repair. 
CROSS BIRD 
Got all this? *Squawk* 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
That sounds like just the ticket for our crew and our ship! 
CROSS BIRD 
Did ye write those steps down in ye book of knowledge? 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
Aye I did! 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
1) Requirement Development and System Analysis 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
2) Logical Analysis and Design Solution 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
3) Implementation 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
4) Integration 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
5) Verification and Validation 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
and 6) Transition 
CROSS BIRD 
So there ye have it, me hearties! That's what systems engineering be all about. Arrr! *Squawk* 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
Aye. Let’s get started. 
CROSS BIRD 
*Squawk* Learning SE can take some time, but it's worth the investment and effort. 
CROSS BIRD 
You and ye crew will come away understanding SE better and how to apply it to ye work as pirate engineers. 
CROSS BIRD 
Are ye game? *Squawk* 
CHIEF ENGINEER 
Let’s do this!!!
