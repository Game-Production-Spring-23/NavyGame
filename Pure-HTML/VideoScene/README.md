# Scene Flow
The flow I found for creating scenes is as follows:

1. Create an HTML page. This page will be separate from all other html pages and is specific to your scene.
2. Create a JavaScript file. This JavaScript file will be specific to your scene.
3. When your scene is set to be finished, load the next scene's html file (possibly with the `loadNewHTMLFile` function in the `lib.js` file).
